Issue #105: "*" did not appear for 2232
- affects 50 postcodes
=> Fixed

But when #106 fixed...
Issue #106: Audley no longer geocoded
- Audley is 2233 in Google geocode now (still 2232 in Google search)
- AusPost has no result for Audley, Deer Park or Royal National Park

Maybe delete localities like this?
i.e. delete localities with ERROR - postcode mismatch

How many localities would this affect? only 9 localities (see geocodeWarnings in Postcodes2Electorates.ods)

Does this seem appropriate (for a sample of them)? Yes

To do it:
/Move these localities to a LocalitiesDeleted sheet
/Refresh pivots and recalculate Localities sheet
/Rerun geocode.py
/Inspect  localities_geocoded.json & rename to localities.json 
/Reload localities.json to test
/Test
/Reload localities.json to prod
/Test in prod
/Email user (Jenni): It's fixed! Thanks for reporting
